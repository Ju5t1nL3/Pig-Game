# Pig Game

This program allows you and others to play a game of the standard dice game Pig.

## Rules

The players take turns rolling a single dice as many times as they want. However, if a player rolls a 1, they score nothing for that round. If they roll any other number, that number is added to the turn total, and they can continue rolling. The other option is to hold, in which their turn total is added to their entire total score. The winner is determined by the first person who reaches the chosen amount of points. This program supports as many players as you would like, and the winning amount of points can also be chosen.
